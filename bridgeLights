#initial values of variables
#numCars is the number of cars, takes user input and converts it to an int
#lightsOn is a boolean that is True when the lights on the bridge are on
numCars = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))
lightsOn = False

#checks the number of cars on the bridge
#it will take new inputs while the number of cars is less than 10
while(numCars < 10):
  lightsOn = False
  numCars = int(input("Enter the number of cars: "))

#once the number of cars on the bridge is at least 10, this code will run
#turns the lights on and prints in the console
lightsOn = True
